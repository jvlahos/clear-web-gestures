# A Gesture Experiment Based on Clear
Using Hammer.js and CSS3, I recreated some gestures and transitions from the iOS/OSX application Clear, right in the web browser.

The root of this repository is the demo page, [A Gesture Experiment Based on Clear](http://www.jeffvlahos.com/clear/). The demo itself, which runs in an `<iframe>` on the demo page, is in the `/demo` directory.
